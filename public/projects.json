        "description": "\"Santurce: Sabor y Arte\" is a fictional event concept inspired by the vibrant culture of Santurce, Puerto Rico. The event is a showcase of Puerto Rican music, food, and art.\n\nFor this project, I designed an event ticket and promotional poster using Adobe Illustrator, incorporating key cultural elements such as the beach, a cuatro (a traditional Puerto Rican stringed instrument), and Santurce’s iconic colorful houses. I brought the design to life by  animating the poster in After Effects, adding movement that enhances the energy and rhythm of the event.",

This inspired me to create Miau Made and bring some joy to felines and their owners! \n\nMy goal was to create a visual identity that is playful and engaging while still maintaining a clean, modern look that would appeal to a wide variety of cat owners. I created hand drawn doodles in Adobe Illustrator and incorporated them with bubbly typography and bright color palettes to reflect the fun of treat time.",
